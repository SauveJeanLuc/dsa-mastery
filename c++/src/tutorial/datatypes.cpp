    Fundamental Data Types

    | Data Type  |     Meaning   |  Size in Bytes |

    |  short int | Short Integer |     2 bytes    |

    |    int     |    Integer    |     4 bytes    |

    |   float    | Floating-Point|     4 bytes    |

    |   double   | Double F-Point|     8 bytes    |

    |    char    |    Character  |     1 byte     |

    |  wchar_t   | Wide Character|     2 bytes    |

    |    bool    |    Boolean    |     1 byte     |

    |    void    |     Empty     |     0 byte     |


    Remember: Bytes = 8 Bits.
    A bit can only hold 0 or 1.

    Type Modifiers

    int, double, char can be modified by signed, unsigned, short, long.

    E.g:
    long double [12 bytes] = used to store large floating points
